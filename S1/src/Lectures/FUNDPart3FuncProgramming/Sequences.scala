  //SEQUENCES
  //Sequences are a very general interface for data structures that
  //  -have a well defined order
  //  -can be indexed

  //Supports various operations
  //apply, iterator, length, reverse for indexing and iterating
  //concatenation, appending, prepending
  //alot of others: grouping, sorting, zipping, searching, slicing

  println(aSequence.sorted)


  //The Sequence companion object actually has an apply factory method that can construct subclasses of
  //Sequence.

  /*
  A LinearSeq immutable linked list

  /*
  The default implementation for immutable sequences
  - effectively contant index read and write: O(log(n))
  - fast element addition: append/prepend
  - implemented as a fixed-branched trie with a branch factor  of 32 elements  at  any one level
  - good performance for larger sizes
